examples:
1. Changing text in sync with image:
    -seperated indexes for slider and content
    -moved slider index into slider
    -had slider update content index, but still needed to be able to wait for this to be done after image is loaded
    -tried udeEffect in SVGImage to trigger contentIndex update, but it totally failed
    -finally looked up if onLoad was a parameter for img, it was, put the update function there
