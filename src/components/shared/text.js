          "A New Yorker by birth and by choice, after a successful   career in corporate sales and account management I am harnessing my creativity, puzzle-solving skills and process-oriented nature to launch a career in web development",
          "I've spent the last several months learning web development using The Odin Project open source curriculum. I'm comfortable working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Webpack, ReactJS and more.",
          "Design is the most fundamental aspect of eveything we make, and even more so as we spend so much time online. I care deeply about responsive and simple designs that make our time online useful, smooth, and sometimes even joyous! I've designed several websites, along with icons, logos and other images as needed in Adobe Illustrator",
