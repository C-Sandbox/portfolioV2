    text: "As I started looking for a way to learn Javascript, I didn't quite trust the for-profit boot camps. Then I found The Odin Project (TOP) on Reddit. Open source and constantly evolving, it was created by a group of web devs to give newbies the knowledge they wish they'd had when they started. I've spent almost a year learning web development with TOP, and it's been wonderful."

    text: "TOP has a great support community on Discord, but you code projects on your own from the start. This gave me the most useful development skill of all: the ability to find solutions on my own. While learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.js, I've used the command line, Git, Chrome Dev Tools, VSCode, and Webpack throughout."
